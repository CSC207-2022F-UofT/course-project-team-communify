Communify is a music platform that aims to collaborize music streaming – allowing users to join live “space” radioes and recommend songs to "space" radios. Generally, it allows users to listen to music and create private playlists. On top of all user features, artists can upload music on their artist dashboard. Communify will also provide recommendations based on the individual songs or playlists and have collaborative ‘spaces’ – public radios that users can both listen to and contribute to.
